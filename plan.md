# This is the plan for my calendar app.

**Features I want to implement:**
- Support for Outlook.com calendar initially, with support for as many types as possible in the future
- Day/Week/Month/Year views
- Horizontal view rather than vertical view (and eventually the option to choose)
- Multiple calendar support with nice colors
- Add multiple events at once (for timetabling)
- Integrated Todoist support for my todo lists
- Natural language support
- Think of a proper name, so I can replace the stupid name of this repo

**Steps required to complete these tasks:**

*Basic calendar display*
- Design a UI
    - Navigation sidebar
    - Main screen grid layout, which changes depending on view selected

*Outlook.com support*
- Login / get user auth token
- Use API to fetch events depending on timeframe shown

*Day/Week/Month/Year views*
- todo

*Horizontal view*
- todo

*Multiple calendar support with nice colors*

*Add multiple events at once*

*Integrated Todoist support*

*Natural language support*

~~Think of a proper name...~~
